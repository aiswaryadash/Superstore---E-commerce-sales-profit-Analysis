# Superstore- E-commerce sales and profit Analysis
## Problem Statement
The superstore e-commerce platform is experiencing fluctuations in sales and profit margins, and there is a need to gain deeper insights into the factors influencing these variations. The goal is to perform a comprehensive sales and profit analysis to identify trends, customer purchasing behavior, and product performance. This analysis will focus on understanding which products, categories, or sub category are driving profits, and which may need further attention or adjustment. Additionally, the analysis will help in evaluating the effectiveness of pricing strategies, promotional campaigns, and seasonal fluctuations. By uncovering these insights, the superstore aims to optimize inventory management, improve pricing strategies, enhance marketing efforts, and maximize profitability.

## Steps 
1. Imported various libraries to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and create visualizations.
2. Converted the data types of date columns to facilitate analysis at the monthly and yearly levels.
3. Created additional columns to support deeper analysis.
4. Developed visualizations to analyze sales and profit data across yearly, monthly, category, sub-category, and segment dimensions.
